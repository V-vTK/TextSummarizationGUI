# TextSummarizationGUI
 A greenfield project focusing on implementing, explaining and evaluating different extractive and abstractive text summarization methods within a graphical user interface. Made for the university of Oulu during my employment, 2023.

 # Usage
  1. Download the project
  2. Install and open docker
  3. Run the build.(bat/sh) file inside the usage folder
  4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
 For more details and the manual installation see the startReadMe file inside usage folder

 # Features
   Features nine summarization methods implemented with [Sumy](https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy) and one abstractive method using Huggingface's [Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/summarization).
   
   The graphical user interface is made with React (CRA), and backend is made with Python utilizing the Flask web framework. The backend and frontend are connected and launched via a docker-compose.
   Evaluation is done using ROUGE and the reference summaries are created using [GPT4All's](https://gpt4all.io/index.html) API interface.

   The application also hosts evaluation scripts outside the graphical user interface.
   **evaluation/SummEval** uses the material and golden summaries provided by [SummEval](https://github.com/Yale-LILY/SummEval)
   
   **evaluation/FalconROUGE** uses the golden summaries generated by the GPT4ALL [Falcon model](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/gpt4all-falcon).
   
   The user can define the source text via a link list. The evaluation script web scrapes the links and generates an "N" ammount of golden summaries for the ROUGE evaluation.

 # Limitations and problems
   GPT4All limitations - The falcon model can't summarize texts that are too large. Summarization also loses efficacy as the text size increases, and the output migh differ significantly from the expected summary.
   
   Abstractive model - The abstractive method was implemented towards the end of the project. It significantly slows down the application and should be moved to a different container to relieve the Flask backend from the processing.
   
   CSS framework - Without a CSS framework, like Tailwind.css, the CSS is quite irregular and repetitive.
   
   JSON database - The JSON database offered a fast way to start developing the application. The application is also easier to start manually without a dedicated database but as the application grew the JSON database got outdated.
   
   Functionality first approach - there is no data validation between the backend and frontend and the documentation is quite lacking.

The project was extremely fun to work on. I got to do almost all of the architecture decisions which was both fun and a valuable learning journey with some mistakes and challenged along the way. I also got to work with a diverse variety of tools including but not limited to: Docker, React, Python, Flask, different api interfaces, batch scripts, Git, React and Python charting libraries, natural language processing libaries, and more ...
