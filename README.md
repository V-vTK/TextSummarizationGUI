# TextSummarizationGUI
 A greenfield project focusing on implementing, explaining and evaluating different extractive and abstractive text summarization methods within a graphical user interface. Made for the university of Oulu during my employment, 2023.

 # Usage
  1. Download the project
  2. Install docker
  3. Run the build.(bat/sh) file inside the usage folder
  4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
 For more details and the manual installation see the startReadMe file inside usage folder

 # Features
   Features nine summarization methods implemented with [Sumy](https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy) and one abstractive method using Huggingface's [Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/summarization).
   
   The graphical user interface is made with React (CRA), and backend is made with Python utilizing the flask web framework. The backend and frontend are connected and launched via a docker-compose.
   Evaluation is done using ROUGE and the reference summaries are created using [GPT4All's](https://gpt4all.io/index.html) API interface.

   The application also hosts evaluation scripts outside the graphical user interface.
   The evaluation/SummEval uses the material and golden summaries provided by [SummEval](https://github.com/Yale-LILY/SummEval)
   The evaluation/FalconROUGE uses the golden summaries generated by the GPT4ALL [Falcon model](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/gpt4all-falcon).
   The user can define the source text via a link list. The evaluation script web scrapes the links and generates an "N" ammount of golden summaries for the ROUGE evaluation.
