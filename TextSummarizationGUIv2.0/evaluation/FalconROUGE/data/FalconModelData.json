I used it to take pictures of the flora and fauna of our neighborhood. My love of photography led me to an Instamatic camera in high school, and eventually to digital cameras as they entered the marketplace in the late 1990s. Early digital cameras provided portability and the ability to quickly capture and easily share images on the internet. But they lacked the quality and complexity of the best of film photography. Of course digital cameras have improved a lot since then. But I have years of digital photographs that just look a little, well, little on modern devices. Until recently, my go-to tool for upscaling digital images has been GIMP. A couple of years ago, I tried to use GIMP to upscale a thumbnail image of my father that was taken in the mid-1940s. It worked, but the photo lacked the detail, depth, and clarity that I wanted. Upscayl works on Linux, Windows, and macOS. It's easy to install on Linux whether your system uses RPM or DEB packages, and its website contains a universal Linux AppImage too. For macOS and Windows, you can download installers from the project's website. Upscayl is released with an AGPL license. Once installed, you can begin upscaling your images. The GUI software is very easy to use. The software makes your old images look like they were taken yesterday with image resolutions that far exceed the originals. In addition, you can batch scale entire folders and photo albums of images and upscale them all at once. Image by: (Don Watkins, CC BY-SA 4.0) Launch the software and click the Select Image button. Find the image or folder of images you want to upscale. Once the image is loaded, select the type of upscaling you want to try. The default is Real-ESRGAN, and that's a good place to start. There are six options to choose from, including a selection for digital art. Next, select the output directory where you want your upscaled images to be saved. And finally, click the Upscayl button to begin the upscaling process. The speed of conversion depends on your GPU and the image output choice you make. Here's a test image, with the low-resolution image on the left and the Upscayl version on the right: Upscayl is one of my favorite upscaling applications. It does depend heavily on your GPU, so it may not work on an old computer or one with an especially weak graphics card. But there's no harm in giving it a try. So download it and try it.

There's seemingly nothing they can't do, regardless of your industry or interest. For instance, did you know you could use a Raspberry Pi or Arduino to help you keep plants alive or to assist you in making tasty beer and barbecue? Over the years, my team at the open source data platform InfluxDB has realized that professional and novice developers can combine a Pi or Arduino with InfluxDB for some unique do-it-yourself projects. This article explores five exciting things you can do with a Raspberry Pi or Arduino and InfluxDB, whether you're a seasoned developer or a beginner. Hopefully, these ideas inspire you (and maybe offer some laughs) ahead of your next tiny computer and InfluxDB project. The developer relations (DevRel) team at InfluxData created the Plant Buddy application, which monitors the temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light for to help users' plants stay alive and thrive. This project showcases using InfluxDB as a storage backend for a Python Flask server, retrieve IoT data, and use Python Dash to visualize the data. My team used an Arduino control board for the project, but treating a Raspberry Pi as a microcontroller is also simple. You could even extend the project to create a tool that monitors any other aspect of weather and the environment. Several of my colleagues at InfluxData are grilling and smoking hobbyists. But even the most basic BBQ enthusiast knows that the key to a great rack of ribs or brisket is cooking at a low and steady temperature. A handful of our developers used Arduino to monitor their BBQ pits. One utilized the monitoring and alerting API built into InfluxDB and assigned statuses based on calculating the difference in temperature between five-minute averages. Anything below 0.02 degrees every five minutes signaled that the meat was stalling. This change produced a \"warn\" status, triggering an alert notification sent directly to the developer's phone. He could then wrap the meat and contain the heat, ultimately resulting in deliciously cooked meat. Once again, you could use the Arduino, Seeduino, or Raspberry Pi to monitor your BBQ pit and make you a true smoke master. Another Influxer set up a new tropical fish tank and monitored the temperature and filter for alerts against any irregularities. He used a temperature and a flowmeter to gather time series data and write it to InfluxDB. The whole project used InfluxDB, Telegraf, Grafana, and a Raspberry Pi to automate and visualize the metrics collected from the aquarium. Templates are prepackaged InfluxDB configurations. The Raspberry Pi template enables you to monitor your Raspberry Pi Linux system to collect metrics, including: Diskio input plugin Mem input plugin Net input plugin Processes input plugin Swap input plugin System input plugin These metrics quickly and easily assure users that their Raspberry Pi device is operating as expected. Image by: (Anais Dotis-Georgiou, CC BY-SA 4.0) He used a digital thermometer to read the temperature of his beer with a webcam, then deployed optical character recognition (OCR) to read the values. Next, he used Raspberry Pi with the open source collection agent Telegraf to send the data to InfluxDB. He also configured alerts that informed him when he needed to tend to the fermentation process and adjust the temperature of his beer-in-the-making. On a related note, I also used Telegraf to make forecasts about those temperature recordings. Users can create exciting projects with an Arduino or Raspberry Pi and InfluxDB for use across various industries such as IoT, home automation, and data science. These examples showcase the creativity developers display when given the right tools and an \"open sandbox\" to play in.

These projects make it easier for developers to interact with APIs and use them in their applications. The openshift-python-wrapper project is a wrapper around openshift-restclient-python. What began as an internal package to help our team work with the OpenShift API became an open source project(Apache License 2.0). This article discusses what an API wrapper is, why it's useful, and some examples from the wrapper. An API wrapper is a layer of code that sits between an application and an API. It simplifies the API access process by abstracting away some of the complexities involved in making requests and parsing responses. A wrapper can also provide additional functionality beyond what the API itself offers, such as caching or error handling. Using an API wrapper makes the code more modular and easier to maintain. Instead of writing custom code for every API, you can use a wrapper that provides a consistent interface for interacting with APIs. It saves time, avoids code duplications, and reduces the chance of errors. Another benefit of using an API wrapper is that it can shield your code from changes to the API. If an API changes its interface, you can update the wrapper code without modifying your application code. This can reduce the work required to maintain your application over time. The application is on PyPi, so install openshift-python-wrapper using the pip command: The OpenShift REST API provides programmatic access to many of the features of the OpenShift platform. The wrapper offers a simple and intuitive interface for interacting with the API using the openshift-restclient-python library. It standardizes how to work with cluster resources and offers unified resource CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) flows. It also provides additional capabilities, such as resource-specific functionality that otherwise needs to be implemented by users. The wrapper makes code easier to read and maintain over time. One example of simplified usage is interacting with a container. Running a command inside a container requires using Kubernetes stream, handling errors, and more. The wrapper handles it all and provides simple and intuitive functionality. Developers or testers can use this wrapper\u2014our team wrote the code while keeping testing in mind. Using Python capabilities, context managers can provide out-of-the-box resource creation and deletion, and inheritance can be used to extend functionality for specific use cases. Pytest fixtures can utilize the code for setup and teardown, leaving no leftovers. Resources can even be saved for debugging. Resource manifests and logs can be easily collected. Here's an example of a context manager: Generators iterate over resources, as seen below: To paraphrase a popular saying, \"If you love your code, set it free.\" The openshift-python-wrapper project started as utility modules for OpenShift Virtualization. As more and more projects benefitted from the code, we decided to extract those utilities into a separate repository and have it open sourced. To paraphrase another common saying, \"If the code does not return to you, it means it was never yours.\" We like saying that once that happens, it's truly open source.

You also make some changes to the same file, commit them, and start pushing the changes to the same Git repository. However, Git detects a conflict because the changes you made conflict with the changes I made. Here's how you can resolve the conflict: Fetch and merge the latest changes from the remote repository: Identify the one or more conflicting files: Open the conflicting file using a text editor: Resolve the conflict. The conflicting changes are marked by<<<<<<< HEAD and>>>>>>>. You need to choose which changes to keep and which to discard. Manually edit the file to combine the conflicting changes. In this example, I changed the website heading to Sample text 1, while you have changed the heading to Sample text 2. Both changes have been added to the file.

In either case, remove the markers that indicate the beginning and end of the changes, leaving only the code you want: Save all of your changes, and close your editor. Add the file to the staging area: This command commits the changes with the message Resolved merge conflict. Push the changes to the remote repository: Merge conflicts are a good reason to focus your changes on code. The more you change in a file, the greater the potential for conflict.

Dependency security is very much in the spotlight. It\u2019s important to stay informed about the software projects you rely upon. But when you\u2019re a software developer, you\u2019re likely using a lot of code from lots of different sources. It\u2019s an intimidating prospect to try to keep up with all the code you include in your own project. That\u2019s where the OpenSSF Scorecard comes in. The OpenSSF\u2019s Scorecard project is an automated tool that assesses a software project\u2019s security practices and risks. According to a recent report by Sonatype, a Scorecard score was one of the best indicators of whether a project had known vulnerabilities. Adopting Scorecard is a great first step to understanding the reliability of the software you use and improving your software supply chain security. Scorecard is a set of benchmarks that allows you to quickly assess the risk associated with a code project based on best security practices. The aggregated project score, ranging from 0 to 10, provides an indication of how seriously a project appears to take security. This is critical for identifying vulnerable points in your supply chain. A dependency that doesn\u2019t meet your own internal security standards may be the weakest link in your software. Examining the individual scores for each of the 19 different Scorecard metrics tells you whether a project\u2019s maintainers follow the practices that are most important to you. Does the project require code review when contributors make changes? Are branches protected against unauthorized deletion or changes? Are dependencies pinned, so that compromised version updates cannot be pushed without review? The Scorecard\u2019s granularity in scoring individual best practices is similar to a good restaurant review that answers the question, \u201cdo I want to eat here?\u201d Moreover, Scorecard provides project maintainers with a to-do list of actionable steps to improve security. You can use Scorecard to evaluate someone else\u2019s software, or you can use it to improve your own. To see a project\u2019s score quickly, you can visit Open Source Insights. This site uses Scorecard data to report on the health of dependencies. For anything not covered on Open Source Insights, you can use the Scorecard command-line utility to scan any project on GitHub, or you can run Scorecard locally: You can run Scorecard on your Git server or on local development machines and trigger it to run with a Git hook. If your code is on GitHub, you can add the GitHub Scorecard Action to your repository. The GitHub Action runs a Scorecard scan after any repository change, so you get immediate feedback if a PR causes a regression in your project\u2019s security. The results provide remediation tips and an indication of severity, enabling you to raise your score and secure your project. Image by: (Naveen Srinivasan, CC BY-SA 4.0) The Scorecard API is a powerful tool that allows you to assess the rigor of a large number of open source projects quickly and easily. With this API, you can check the scores of over 1.25 million GitHub repositories that are scanned weekly. The API provides a wealth of information about the security practices of each project, allowing you to quickly identify vulnerabilities and take action to protect your software supply chain. This data can also be used to automate the process of judging software, making it easy to ensure that your software is always secure and up to date. Whether you\u2019re a project owner or a consumer of open source software, the Scorecard API is an essential tool for ensuring the security and reliability of your code. When you\u2019ve made progress in improving your score, don\u2019t forget to add a badge to showcase your hard work. Currently, the OpenSSF Scorecard is becoming widely adopted, and as one of its developers, I\u2019m excited about the future. If you try it out, don\u2019t hesitate to contact us through the contact section of the repository and share your feedback. The Scorecard crowd is growing, and many users are already benefiting from the tool. According to Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, \u201cCNCF uses Scorecards in a variety of its projects to improve security practices across the cloud native ecosystem.\u201d OpenSSF Scorecard is an automated and practical tool that enables you to assess the security of open source software and take steps to improve your software supply chain security.

Accessibility is about designing websites that can be used by people with disabilities, such as visual or hearing impairments, as well as those who rely on assistive technology like screen readers. In this article, I\u2019ll explore recommendations for creating accessible websites with Drupal, a popular open source content management system. First, consider why accessibility is important. According to the World Health Organization, over 1 billion people worldwide live with some form of disability. In the United States alone, 26% of adults have some form of disability. Ensuring that websites are accessible is not only a moral imperative, it\u2019s also a legal requirement. In the US, websites must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, which sets standards for accessibility in federal agencies. Here are some tips for creating accessible websites with Drupal: Choose accessible themes and modules: When selecting themes and modules for your Drupal website, it\u2019s important to choose those designed with accessibility in mind. The Drupal community has created a number of themes and modules that are specifically designed for accessibility. You can also use tools like the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE) to test the accessibility of themes and modules before you install them. Design for keyboard navigation: Many people with disabilities rely on keyboard navigation to access websites. To ensure that your Drupal website can be navigated using a keyboard, you should make sure that all interactive elements are reachable with a keyboard and that the order in which elements are accessed with the keyboard makes sense. You can use the Drupal Accessibility module to test your website\u2019s keyboard navigation. Use ARIA attributes: Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of attributes that can be added to HTML elements to make them more accessible. ARIA attributes can be used to provide additional information to assistive technology, such as screen readers. For example, you can use ARIA attributes to describe the purpose of a button or a link. Drupal has built-in support for ARIA attributes. Test for accessibility compliance: To ensure that your Drupal website is accessible, test it for compliance with accessibility standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). There are a number of tools available for testing accessibility compliance, such as Accessibility Insights for Web. Several organizations have successfully implemented accessible websites using Drupal. Here are two of my favorite. University of Colorado Boulder: The University of Colorado Boulder used Drupal to redesign its website with accessibility in mind. They used Drupal\u2019s built-in accessibility features, as well as custom modules, to ensure that their website is compliant with accessibility standards. As a result, they saw a significant increase in traffic and engagement from users with disabilities. Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center: Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center used Drupal to create an accessible website for patients and their families. They used Drupal\u2019s built-in accessibility features, as well as custom modules, to provide features like keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes. The website has been praised for its accessibility and has won several awards. Creating accessible websites is essential for ensuring that everyone can access digital content. Drupal has a number of features and modules that can help make websites more accessible, including built-in accessibility features, themes and modules designed for accessibility, and support for ARIA attributes. By implementing these recommendations, you can create an accessible website that provides a better user experience for all users.

Spoiler \u2014 it's community. Community is what drives an open source project, and documentation is one of the foundational blocks for building a community. In other words, documentation isn't only about documentation. Establishing good documentation can be difficult, though. Users don't read documentation because it's inconvenient, it goes out of date very quickly, there's too much, or there's not enough. The development team doesn't write documentation because of the \"it's obvious for me, so it's obvious to everyone\" trap. They don't write because they are too busy making the project exist. Things are developing too fast, or they're not developing fast enough. But good documentation remains the best communication tool for groups and projects. This is especially true considering that projects tend to get bigger over time. Documentation can be a single source of truth within a group or a company. This is important when coordinating people toward a common goal and preserving knowledge as people move on to different projects. So how do you write appropriate documentation for a project and share it with the right people? To succeed in writing documentation in your community: Make it clear and straightforward Be flexible, make changes to the routine according to a specific situation Image by: (Olga Merkulova, CC BY-SA 4.0) Being flexible doesn't mean being chaotic. Many projects have succeeded just because they are well-organized. James Clear (author of Atomic Habits) wrote, \"You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.\" Be sure to organize the process so that the level is high enough to achieve success. Documentation is a project. Think of writing docs as writing code. In fact, documentation can be a product and a very useful one at that. This means you can use the same processes as in software development: analysis, capturing requirements, design, implementation, and maintenance. Make documentation one of your processes. Think about it from different perspectives while designing the process. Not all documentation is the right documentation for everyone. Most users only need a high-level overview of a project, while API documentation is probably best reserved for developers or advanced users. Developers need library and function documentation. Users are better served by example use cases, step-by-step guides, and an architectural overview of how a project fits in with the other software they use. Image by: (Olga Merkulova, CC BY-SA 4.0) Ultimately, before creating any process, you must determine what you need: Focus groups: this includes developers, integrators, administrators, users, sales, operations, executives Level of expertise: Keep in mind the beginner, intermediate, and advanced users Level of detail: There's room for a high-level overview as well as technical detail, so consider how you want these to be presented Journeys and entry points: How do people find the documentation, how they use it When you ponder these questions, it helps you structure information you want to communicate through documentation. It defines clear metrics on what has to be in the documentation. Here's how to approach building a process around documentation. The code itself should make sense. Documentation should be expressed through good class names, file names, and so on. Create common coding standards and make a self-documented code process by thinking about: Variable naming conventions Make names understandable by using class, function naming schemes Do not simply copy-and-paste code No long methods should be used Avoid using magic numbers (use const instead) Use extract methods, variables, and so on Use meaningful directory structures, modules, packages, and files Testing isn't only about how code should behave. It's also about how to use an API, functions, methods, and so on. Well-written tests can reveal base and edge case scenarios. There's even a test-driven development practice that focuses on creating test cases (step by step scenarios of what should be tested and how) before code development. Version control, even for your documentation, helps you track the logic of your changes. It can help you answer why a change was made. Make sure comments during commits explain WHY a change was made, not WHAT change was made. The more engaging the documentation process is, the more people will get into it. Add creativity and fun to it. You should think about readability of documentation by using: software code conventions diagrams and graphs (that are also explained in text) images (highlight important parts) By using different ways of communication, you offer more ways to engage with your documentation. This can help forestall misunderstanding (different languages, different meanings), and different learning styles. Here are some software tools for creating documentation: Javadoc, Doxygen, JsDoc, and so on: Many languages have automated documentation tools to help capture major features in code Web hooks and CI/CD engines: Allows continuous publication of your documentation Restructured Text, Markdown, Asciidoc: File formats and processing engines help you produce beautiful and usable documentation out of plain text files ReadTheDocs: Is a documentation host that can be attached to a public Git repository Draw.io, LibreOffice Draw, Dia: Produce diagrams, graphs, mind-maps, roadmaps, planning, standards, and metrics Peek, Asciinema: Use commands for recording your terminal VokoscreenNG: Use mouse clicks and screen capture Documenting processes and protocols are just as important as documenting your project itself. Most importantly, make information about your project and creation of your project exciting. The speed of entering into a project and process, and understanding how everything works, is an important feature. It helps ensure continued engagement. Simple processes and a clear understanding of what needs to be done is obtained by building one \"language\" in the team. Documentation is designed to convey value, which means demonstrating something through words and deeds. It doesn't matter whether it's a member of your team or a user of your application. Think about the process as a continuum and use means of communication, processes, and documentation.
